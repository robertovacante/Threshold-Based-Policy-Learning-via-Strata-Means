# Threshold-Based-Policy-Learning-via-Strata-Means
Stata code for threshold policy learning in stratified randomized data. It builds a simple score from stratum means, evaluates a percentile path with inverse probability weighting, and computes stratified bootstrap bands. It also reports group composition and mismatch diagnostics and exports clear two panel plots per outcome.
